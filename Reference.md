## Options

### Use Default Filter

Default: `Off`

To ensure that looks are the same as in Tiled, all layer texture filters are set to "nearest".
Setting this option to `On` leaves all texture filters as they are by default ('inherited').

### Add Class as Metadata
###### (new since version 1.5.0)

Default: `Off`

If enabled the content of the Tiled class field is added to the metadata of the corresponding Godot elment.

### Add Id as Metadata
###### (new since version 1.6.2)

Default: `Off`

If enabled the Tiled object id is added to the metadata of the corresponding Godot elment.

### No Alternative Tiles
###### (new since version 1.6.5)

Default: `Off`

If enabled any flipped/rotated tiles are no longer created as alternative tiles.  
An enhancement in Godot 4.2 makes this possible.  
*Please note: Rotated non-sqare tiles may appear wrongly placed if this option is `On`.  
This currently can't be avoided due to Godot specifics.*

### Map Wangset to Terrain
###### (new since version 1.4.0)

Default: `Off`

Switch on the 'old' (prior to version 1.4.0) mapping where Tiled wangsets ('terrain sets') were mapped to Godot terrains to keep the terrain set names.

### Tiled Project File
###### (new since version 1.6.0)

Default: `None`

Enable the use of Tiled's Custom Types by specifying the Tiled project file (.tiled-project).

### Post Processor

Default: `None`

After import you can manipulate the genereted map by a post processor script. The script must have a method "_post_process" with
a parameter of type Node2D (the base node of the generated map) and return the changed map as Node2D.  

Further GDScript requirements: "extends Node"

Mini Example (manipulating the Material setting on element with name 'Area2'):

```py
extends Node

func _post_process(base_node: Node2D):
	var area = base_node.find_child("Area2")
	var mat = CanvasItemMaterial.new()
	mat.blend_mode = CanvasItemMaterial.BLEND_MODE_MUL
	area.material = mat
	return base_node
	
```

Further C# Script requirements: Class name like .cs filename and inherit from Node.

Equivalent mini example (Post processor file is named 'PostProcessor.cs'):

```py
using Godot;

public partial class PostProcessor: Node
{
    public Node2D _PostProcess(Node2D baseNode)
    {
        var area = (Area2D)baseNode.FindChild("Area2");
        var mat = new CanvasItemMaterial();
        mat.BlendMode = CanvasItemMaterial.BlendModeEnum.Mul;
        area.Material = mat;
        return baseNode;
    }
}
	
```

### Save Tileset To

Default: `None`

Every map generated by the importer gets a Godot TileSet. This TileSet can be exported to a .tres file to use it otherwise.

## Mapping from Tiled elements to Godot elements

Where applicable the mapping is controlled by an entry in the Tiled class field.<br>
**New since version 1.5.0:**  Mapping can alternatively be controlled by a custom property 'godot_node_type'.<br>
Probably this new way is preferable if you want to keep open the use of Tiled's Custom Types.

Tile collision elements are controlled by custom properties of type 'int'.  
Property value is the assigned layer number.

**Names:** The Tiled element name entry is mapped to the Godot element name.  
If the Tiled name entry is empty a default Godot element name is created to avoid cryptic looking names.

## Custom properties reference

Setting these properties affect the Godot settings accordingly.  
Custom properties which are not in this list or not fitting to the element are added as Meta Data or - if assigned to a tile - as Custom Data.

> **Tile** custom properties: The property name and type will refer to a layer in the Godot TileSets's Custom Data Layer array,   
the property value is assigend to the tile's Custom Data entry which conists only of the layer number and the value.

New since v1.5.4: A special custom property `godot_group` to specify the Godot Group to which the imported element is assigned.  
You can assign more than one group by passing the group names as a comma-separated list.

New since v1.6.0: You can download [this file](./supplemental/godot_enums.json) containing several Godot enums and import it using the Custom Type Editor

New since v1.6.6: A special custom property `godot_script` to specify a node script.  

New since v1.6.8: A special custom property `godot_atlas_id` to force special atlas id values.  
The property is either a tileset property or in case of an image collection tileset a tile property.  
**Please use this property only if you know what you're doing and why!** 

Remarks:  
- (*) refers to a string consisting of comma separated values, each value representing an element number to enable.  
Example for a collision layer property (name+value), where layers 1,3,5,6,7 on physics layer 0 are to enable:  
`collision_layer_0 = 1,3,5-7` (you can set ranges like 5-7 in this example)
- (col) refers to a string consisting of an # followed by hex (RGB) values. Example: `#4e4aff`
- (enum) refers to an int, value can be taken from the list

Properties with "n is layer number": if number appendix is missing, layer 0 is assumed  
i.e. "collision_layer" is equivalent to "collision_layer_0"

Properties of type 'file' refer to previously saved Godot resources e.g. 'material' or a script file.  
By specifing the property and setting its value to the resource file path the resource will be loaded.  
**Please note:** The numerous resource-specific properties, e.g. for materials, can only be set by loading previously saved resources.  
This seems to be convenient as providing all of these properties would greatly inflate the already extensive list.

## Specialities

- For some custom properties e.g. 'use_parent_material' there's a catch that this can be ambiguous.  
`Example: A rectangle with class 'staticbody' is mapped to a StaticBody2D (parent) + a CollisionShape2D (child).`  
`Both elements do have a 'use_parent_material' property. Which one of them should the property affect?`  
By default the property affects the parent.  
If you want the property to affect the child, prefix the name with two underscores e.g. '__use_parent_material'
- If linear texture filters are in effect, on tile objects (which are mapped to a Sprite2D) it may happen that the sprite shows artifacts on the border.  
This can be overcome by adding a special property to the object named 'clip_artifacts' and setting it to `On`.
- Skip Tiled layers by adding a custom property 'no_import' (type bool) and set it to 'true' (new in v1.2).
