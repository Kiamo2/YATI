# YATI (Yet Another Tiled Importer) for Godot 4

This is an addon for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) for importing files (.tmx, .tmj)
created by the [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org).

**Please note: This addon is for Godot 4 only and won't work with Godot 3.x**

Tested on Windows 10 with Godot 4.3/4.2.2 and Tiled 1.11.0 (Tiled maps from older Tiled versions may work too)

Latest version: 2.1.9 (needs Godot 4.3.0 or higher)  
Downloads: [GDScript version](../../releases/download/v2.1.9/v2.1.9-gdscript.zip) / [CSharp version](../../releases/download/v2.1.9/v2.1.9-csharp.zip)

Latest version for Godot 4.2.x: 1.7.1  
Version 1.7.1 downloads: [GDScript version](../../releases/download/v1.7.1/v1.7.1-gdscript.zip) / [CSharp version](../../releases/download/v1.7.1/v1.7.1-csharp.zip)

**New since v1.5.2:** Runtime packages are now additionally available.  
For installation and usage please refer to the [runtime document](Runtime.md)

## Installation

The addon is available in GDScript as well as in C# for the Mono version of Godot 4.

- Download either the [GDScript version](../../releases/download/v2.1.9/v2.1.9-gdscript.zip) or the [CSharp version](../../releases/download/v2.1.9/v2.1.9-csharp.zip)
- Move the unzipped addon folder with its entire content to your Godot project folder
- After starting your project in Godot the plugin should appear at Project>>Project Settings...>>Plugins

>**C# version:** Run your project once for building the plugin, otherwise enabling will fail  
'Run your project' means 'Press the Play button'. For this to work a main scene must have been configured.`

- Enable the plugin by ticking the enable checkbox

## Usage

- Place your Tiled map(s) with all its parts (.PNGs/.tsx/.tsj/.tx/.tj/...) somewhere inside your Godot project.    
  If you do this by copying a full Tiled project from elsewhere please ensure that its folder structure is preserved.  
  (Otherwise, the references stored in the maps and tilesets may be incorrect and errors will occur)
- Please check: Tiled editor should seamlessly work with all maps *inside* your project i.e. all its references must be ok

> Strictly speaking, only the tiled map files (.tmx/.tmj) and the map resources (.PNGs) *need* to be inside your Godot project so that they can be recognised and imported by Godot.
Tilesets - if they are not embedded anyway - *can* be outside the Godot project as long as they are correctly referenced in the map file(s).
The same goes for template files (.tx/.tj) and Tiled project files.  
However, I doubt this to be very useful, as the PNG files referenced by the tileset must also be inside the project.  
Thus we'd end up with internal references pointing outwards and external references pointing inwards.

- Once these requirements are all met, (re-)starting the project lets the import run automatically
- **Important recommendation:** Untick "Use multiple threads" in Project Settings (Advanced) Editor>>Import  
Otherwise - if you have more than one Tiled map - Godot may freeze (+crash) during import.

## Features

(Hopefully) nearly all Tiled features are supported:
- all kinds of layers
- all kinds of objects
- all map orientations 
- visibility, opacity, tint, offsets, probability
- parallaxes
- tile collisions
- tile animations
- templates
- custom properties  
...

By assigning values to the class attributes and by setting custom properties the resulting scene can be largely customized.

For details please refer to the [reference document](Reference.md)

## Limitations & Particularities

1. Ellipses are not available in Godot. Where appropriate a capsule is used instead. (Where not appropriate it's skipped)
2. Tileset animation in Godot requires involved tiles being equidistant and either horizontally or vertically arranged.<p>
In Tiled you can randomly choose every frame tile, such animations won't map and are skipped.
3. Godot 4 seems to make a left-down render - at least the 'perspective walls' example from the Tiled github site suggests this.  
I've not yet found anything to change this.
4. The C# version does not support zstd compression.
5. I'm currently using Windows 10 therefore I can only ensure the functionality for this OS.

## Known issues

1. Godot may freeze during import, see my recommendation concerning "Use Multiple Threads" in the Usage section.  
Maybe this is only a problem on Windows though...

## Support

Support is active i.e. if issues should arise I'll do my best to resolve them.<br>
If you would like to sponsor the project I'd be thrilled if you [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kiamo2).
